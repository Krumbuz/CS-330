# CS 330 Final Project Reflection

## How do I approach designing software?
I start by understanding the requirements and planning out a basic structure. I like to sketch or outline the major components before coding.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me improve my skills in object positioning, applying textures, and managing lighting in a 3D environment.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a cycle of planning, building, testing, and revising based on what looked and performed best.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts and constantly testing can help me in future projects.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I like to build simple pieces first and then add complexity gradually, checking my progress after each step.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used incremental building and modular coding to keep the project organized and easier to debug.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was keyâ€”after each major change, I tested the scene to see what needed adjustment.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
I've become more comfortable with experimenting and fixing bugs early rather than waiting until the end.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It gives me technical and creative tools that open up more career and educational opportunities.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They give me a better understanding of how to create user experiences and visuals that can be applied in fields like game design, simulation, or UI design.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Understanding computational graphics makes me more versatile in tech roles, especially those involving multimedia, games, VR, or 3D modeling.
